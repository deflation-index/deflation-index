## 🎯 Current Scope & Limitations

### What's Included in v3.1.1

The Deflation Index currently measures **four foundational technology sectors**:

| Sector | Coverage Period | Cumulative Deflation |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Computing | 1990-2024 (35 years) | -99.88% |
| Communications | 1990-2024 (35 years) | -99.27% |
| Energy | 1990-2024 (35 years) | -98.42% |
| Transportation | 2010-2024 (15 years) | -82.59% |

**Coverage:** These sectors represent approximately **40% of direct technological impact** on the US economy.

### Why These Four Sectors?

We selected these sectors because they are **foundational technologies** that:

1. ✅ **Enable other sectors** – Computing powers everything from healthcare to finance; energy is required for all economic activity
2. ✅ **Show measurable deflation** – Clear cost-per-performance metrics ($/GFLOPS, $/kWh, $/GB)
3. ✅ **Have high-quality data** – Tier 1 sources from government agencies and established institutions
4. ✅ **Represent diverse types** – Digital (computing, communications), physical (energy, transportation)

**This is not cherry-picking.** These are the sectors where:
- Data quality is highest (Tier 1: FRED, IRENA, BloombergNEF, BLS, DOE)
- Measurements are most reliable (standardized metrics, authoritative sources)
- Deflation is most consistent (35-year time series demonstrates trend durability)

### What's NOT Included (Yet)

**Sectors excluded from v3.1.1:**

| Sector | Status | Reason for Exclusion |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Healthcare | ❌ Planned v4.0 (2026-2027) | Complexity costs rising despite tech deflation (genomic sequencing ↓99.9%, but healthcare spending ↑) |
| Education | ❌ Planned v4.0 (2026-2027) | Mixed signals: online learning ↓90% cost, but university tuition ↑400% |
| Housing | ❌ Planned v4.0 (2027-2028) | Methodology needs development: how to isolate tech deflation (modular construction) from land/regulatory costs? |
| Food/Agriculture | ⏸️ Under evaluation | Genetic engineering delivers deflation, but consumer prices complex (distribution, retail markup) |
| Manufacturing | ⏸️ Under evaluation | Automation delivers productivity, but complexity costs may offset |

**Why excluded?** Not because they don't matter or don't have technological deflation, but because:
1. **Data quality insufficient** for Tier 1 inclusion (require Tier 2-3 sources with lower reliability)
2. **Complexity costs may offset deflation** (healthcare tech improves, but system costs rise faster)
3. **Methodology needs development** (isolating technology deflation from other factors is challenging)

**We'd rather be accurate with 4 sectors than speculative with 10.**

### Roadmap for Expansion

**Our expansion plan maintains quality standards while broadening coverage:**

#### v3.1.1 (Current — April 2026)
- 2025 early-read panel (M2, CPI, batteries, AI compute) added to site
- Live FRED CSV retrieval (M2SL + CPIAUCSL)
- Weighted 1990–2024 DI unchanged

#### v4.0 (Q3 2026) – Full 2025 recalculation
- Rebuild weighted DI with 2025 endpoints for all four sectors
- Gated on IRENA *Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2025* (~July 2026) and NREL ATB 2025

#### v5.0 (2027-2028) – Healthcare Sector
**Target:** Add healthcare as 5th sector
- **Metrics:** Genomic sequencing costs ($/genome), medical imaging ($/scan), telemedicine ($/consultation)
- **Challenge:** Isolate technology deflation from system complexity and regulatory costs
- **Coverage:** ~50% of technological impact when combined with existing 4 sectors
- **Methodology:** Collaborate with health economists on quality-adjusted measurements

#### v5.1 (2027) – Education Sector  
**Target:** Add education as 6th sector
- **Metrics:** Online learning costs, digital textbook prices, AI tutoring costs
- **Challenge:** Separate technology benefits from credential inflation
- **Coverage:** ~55-60% of technological impact
- **Methodology:** Work with education researchers on learning outcome measurements

#### v6.0 (2028) – Housing/Construction Sector
**Target:** Add housing as 7th sector
- **Metrics:** Modular construction costs, building automation, smart home technology
- **Challenge:** Isolate technology costs from land values and regulatory burdens
- **Coverage:** ~65-70% of technological impact
- **Methodology:** Partner with urban economists on hedonic housing models

**Goal:** Expand to **7+ sectors representing 60-70% of technological impact by 2028.**

### Transparency Commitment

We explicitly acknowledge our limitations:

✅ **Current index is partial, not comprehensive** (40% coverage)  
✅ **Findings are robust within measured sectors** (sensitivity analysis confirms)  
✅ **Expansion planned with same quality standards** (no compromise on data rigor)  
✅ **Transparent about what's included and excluded** (no hidden assumptions)

**Core principle:** We'd rather have a smaller index that's bulletproof than a larger index that's questionable.

## 🔄 Sensitivity Analysis

We provide two weighting methodologies to demonstrate robustness:

| Methodology | 2024 DI | Cumulative | Annual |
|-------------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Multi-Factor (Primary)** | 3.74 | -96.25% | -9.21% |
| Equal-Weighted (Baseline) | 4.96 | -95.04% | -8.45% |

**Key Finding**: Both methodologies confirm massive technological deflation (95-96% cumulative). See [VARIANTS.md](methodology/VARIANTS.md) for details.
