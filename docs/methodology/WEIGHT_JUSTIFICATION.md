# Weight Justification and Sensitivity Analysis

**Deflation Index v3.0.3**  
**Date**: January 2026  
**Status**: Final (Sensitivity Analysis Verified)

---

## Overview

This document provides detailed justification for the sector weights used in the Master Deflation Index and demonstrates the robustness of our findings through sensitivity analysis.

**Current Weights (v3.0.3)**:
- Computing: 29.41%
- Communications: 23.53%
- Energy: 29.41%
- Transportation: 17.65%

## Weighting Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Weights should reflect the relative importance of each technology sector's contribution to economy-wide deflation.

**Three Dimensions Considered**:
1. **GDP Contribution**: Direct economic value generated by the sector
2. **Enabling Effect**: Degree to which other sectors depend on this technology
3. **Deflationary Force**: Magnitude and consistency of cost reductions

**Note**: These are v3.0.3 weights with four sectors. When v4.0 adds healthcare, education, and housing, all weights will be rebalanced with rigorously-sourced methodologies.

## Sector-by-Sector Justification

### Computing (29.4%)

**GDP Contribution**: Moderate-High
- Direct: ~2-3% of US GDP from computer/electronic manufacturing
- Indirect: Powers 30-40% of economic activity through IT services, software, data

**Enabling Effect**: Extreme
- Computing underpins nearly all modern economic activity
- Critical input for: communications, finance, healthcare, education, manufacturing, retail
- Most "general purpose technology" - affects everything

**Deflationary Force**: Extreme
- 99.9%+ cost reduction over 35 years
- Most consistent exponential improvement (Moore's Law)
- Ongoing: AI, quantum computing maintaining trend

**Justification for 29.4%**:
- Highest enabling effect justifies high weight
- Moderate GDP contribution prevents overweighting
- Extreme deflationary force supports prominence
- Result: Tied for highest weight with Energy

### Communications (23.5%)

**GDP Contribution**: Moderate
- ~1-2% of GDP from telecommunications services
- Indirect: Enables remote work, e-commerce, digital services

**Enabling Effect**: High
- Essential infrastructure for modern economy
- Critical for: information flow, commerce, remote work, entertainment
- Near-universal adoption required for participation

**Deflationary Force**: Extreme
- 99.8%+ cost reduction in data transmission
- Ongoing: 5G, fiber, satellite internet maintaining trend
- Both wired and wireless costs collapsed

**Justification for 23.5%**:
- Lower GDP contribution than computing/energy
- High but not extreme enabling effect (more specialized than computing)
- Extreme deflationary force supports substantial weight
- Result: Third-highest weight among four sectors

### Energy (29.4%)

**GDP Contribution**: High
- ~8-10% of US GDP from energy sector
- Universal input - every economic activity requires energy
- Largest single commodity market

**Enabling Effect**: Extreme
- Literally powers all economic activity
- Critical constraint on growth
- Universal dependency across all sectors

**Deflationary Force**: High
- ~90% cost reduction in solar LCOE over 35 years
- Ongoing: Solar + storage approaching grid parity globally
- LED lighting: 95%+ cost reduction

**Justification for 29.4%**:
- Highest GDP contribution justifies high weight
- Extreme enabling effect (universal input)
- High (not extreme) deflationary force due to later start (solar cheaper than coal only recently)
- Result: Tied for highest weight with Computing

### Transportation (17.6%)

**GDP Contribution**: Moderate-High
- ~3-5% of GDP from transportation services
- ~3-4% from vehicle manufacturing
- Critical for goods movement, commuting

**Enabling Effect**: Moderate-High
- Essential for physical goods economy
- Critical for: supply chains, commuting, logistics
- Less universal than energy/computing but still foundational

**Deflationary Force**: High
- ~88% battery cost reduction over 15 years (2010-2024)
- Ongoing: EV cost parity approaching, range improving
- Earlier tech (ICE) had slower improvement

**Justification for 17.6%**:
- Moderate GDP contribution
- Moderate-high enabling effect (less universal than other three)
- High deflationary force but shorter time series (only 15 years of data)
- Result: Lowest weight reflects shorter coverage period and more specialized impact

## Weight Derivation Methodology

### Step 1: Base Weights

Initial weights assigned based on three-factor analysis:
- Computing: 25% (high enabling, extreme deflation)
- Communications: 20% (high enabling, extreme deflation)
- Energy: 25% (high GDP, extreme enabling)
- Transportation: 15% (newer sector, shorter time series)
- Reserved: 15% (for future sectors)

### Step 2: Normalization to Four Sectors

With only four sectors currently, normalize to 100%:

**Calculation**:
- Computing: 25% ÷ 0.85 = 29.41%
- Communications: 20% ÷ 0.85 = 23.53%
- Energy: 25% ÷ 0.85 = 29.41%
- Transportation: 15% ÷ 0.85 = 17.65%
- **Total: 100.00%**

### Step 3: v4.0 Rebalancing (Future)

When healthcare, education, and housing are added:
- All weights will be rebalanced across 7 sectors
- Plan to implement rigorously-sourced sensitivity analyses
- Expenditure-weighting derived from BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey
- GDP-weighting derived from BEA GDP-by-Industry data

## Sensitivity Analysis

**Question**: How sensitive are our results to the choice of weights?

**Method**: Compare our Multi-Factor methodology against an equal-weighted baseline that makes zero assumptions about sector importance.

### Equal-Weighted Baseline

**File**: `master_deflation_index_v3.0.1_EQUAL.xlsx`

**Weights**:
- Computing: 25%
- Communications: 25%
- Energy: 25%
- Transportation: 25%

**Rationale**: No judgment about relative importance; treat all sectors equally. This is the most conservative, assumption-free approach.

**Result** (verified):
- 2024 Master DI: **4.96**
- Annual average deflation: **-8.45%**
- Cumulative deflation: **-95.04%**

**Interpretation**: Slightly lower deflation than Multi-Factor because equal weighting reduces emphasis on fastest-deflating sectors (Computing at 99.88%, Communications at 99.27%).

### Summary of Sensitivity Analysis

| Weighting Method | Weights (C/Co/E/T) | 2024 DI | Annual Avg | Cumulative |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Multi-Factor (Primary)** | **29/24/29/18** | **3.74** | **-9.21%** | **-96.25%** |
| Equal-Weighted (Baseline) | 25/25/25/25 | 4.96 | -8.45% | -95.04% |

**Range**: -8.45% to -9.21% annual (0.76pp spread)

**Key Findings**:

1. **Core finding robust**: Both methods show substantial deflation (95-96% cumulative)
2. **Direction unchanged**: Massive technological deflation confirmed regardless of weighting
3. **Narrow range**: Results vary by less than 1 percentage point annually
4. **Both dwarf inflation**: Even conservative estimate (-95.04%) far exceeds CPI inflation

**Why Multi-Factor Shows Higher Deflation**:

The Multi-Factor weights give more emphasis to Computing (29.41%) and Communications (23.53%) than equal weighting. These are the fastest-deflating sectors (99.88% and 99.27% respectively). This is intentional—these sectors have extreme "enabling effects" on the broader economy that pure equal-weighting doesn't capture.

**Transparency Note**: We publish both files so users can verify results and choose their preferred methodology. The core finding—massive technological deflation—holds regardless of which approach is used.

## Why Only Two Methodologies?

**Previous versions** included Expenditure-Weighted and GDP-Weighted variants. We removed these in v3.0.3 because:

1. **Unverifiable claims**: The labels implied derivation from BLS/BEA data that we hadn't rigorously implemented
2. **Mapping challenges**: Our 4 technology sectors don't cleanly map to official expenditure/GDP categories
3. **Prioritizing accuracy**: We prefer fewer, bulletproof methodologies over more variants with weak foundations

**Future plans** (v4.0, 2027-2028):
- When we expand to 7+ sectors with comprehensive coverage
- Implement rigorous expenditure-weighting from BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey
- Implement rigorous GDP-weighting from BEA GDP-by-Industry data
- Welcome collaboration from economists on methodology development

## Comparison to Other Indices

### BLS Hedonic Price Indices
**Approach**: Expenditure-weighted, sector-specific, quality-adjusted
**Strength**: Official data, comprehensive coverage
**Limitation**: Conservative hedonic adjustments, doesn't isolate technology vs. other factors

### Our World in Data Technology Cost Indices
**Approach**: Technology-specific, learning curves, global data
**Strength**: Long time series, visual storytelling
**Limitation**: Not aggregated into single index, sector-specific only

### The Deflation Index Approach
**Difference**: 
- Multi-sector aggregation (4 now, 7+ future)
- Explicit comparison to M2/CPI (reveals gaps)
- Cost-per-performance focus (not general prices)
- Transparent weighting with baseline provided

**Trade-offs**:
- More comprehensive than single-sector indices
- More focused than BLS (tech only vs. all consumption)
- More transparent in methodology and assumptions

## Limitations and Caveats

### What Weights Don't Capture

**Adoption Curves**: Weights assume instant full adoption. Reality: new tech takes time to reach scale.

**Network Effects**: Some technologies (communications, computing) have increasing returns to scale not captured in weights.

**Quality of Life**: Weights based on economic measures, not utility/happiness improvements.

**Regional Variation**: US-centric weights may not apply globally.

### Why These Limitations Are Acceptable

The goal is not perfect measurement of "true importance" (impossible to define). The goal is:
1. **Defensible methodology** that others can critique and improve
2. **Robust findings** that hold across reasonable alternatives
3. **Transparent assumptions** so users can adjust if desired

The sensitivity analysis shows: even with equal weighting (zero assumptions), the core finding remains.

## Future Improvements

### v4.0 Methodology Enhancements (2027-2028)

**Plan**:
1. Expand to 7+ sectors (add healthcare, education, housing)
2. Implement BLS-derived expenditure-weighting
3. Implement BEA-derived GDP-weighting
4. Provide user choice via API parameters

**Data Requirements**:
- Healthcare sector fully developed
- Education sector fully developed
- Housing sector fully developed
- Rigorous mapping to official BLS/BEA categories

### Academic Collaboration

**Seeking partnerships**:
- Econometricians for optimal weighting theory
- Price index experts for methodology validation
- Sector specialists for domain-specific refinement

**Goal**: Peer-reviewed methodology paper establishing best practices for multi-sector technology price indices.

## Conclusion

**The current weighting system (29.4%, 23.5%, 29.4%, 17.6%) is:**
1. ✅ Justified by three-factor framework (GDP, enabling effect, deflation)
2. ✅ Robust to alternative specifications (Equal-weighted baseline confirms finding)
3. ✅ Transparent and documented for scrutiny
4. ✅ Appropriate for 4-sector partial coverage

**The core finding is robust**: Technology delivered massive deflation (-95% to -96% cumulative) regardless of weighting choice.

**The methodology will improve**: v4.0 will add rigorously-sourced sensitivity analyses when comprehensive coverage achieved.

**We welcome critique**: Challenge our assumptions, propose alternatives, suggest improvements. The goal is the best measurement possible, not defending any particular method.
