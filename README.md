# The Deflation Index

**Quantifying technological deflation across computing, communications, energy, and transportation.**

The Deflation Index (DI) measures the force of technological progress by tracking exponential cost reductions in fundamental sectors and comparing them against monetary expansion and official inflation metrics.

## 📊 What is the DI?

The Deflation Index is a composite metric that quantifies annual technological deflation from 1990-2024. It reveals the gap between:

* **What technology delivers** (massive cost reductions)
* **What monetary policy creates** (6-7% M2 expansion annually)
* **What we experience** (2-3% CPI inflation)

**Key Findings (1990-2024):**
- **Technology deflation**: -96.26% cumulative (-9.21% annual average)
- **M2 money supply growth**: +615% cumulative (+5.9% annual average)
- **CPI inflation**: +155% cumulative (+2.7% annual average)
- **The Abundance Gap**: 560 percentage points of captured wealth
- **The Deflation Gap**: 251 percentage points of missing deflation

## 🔍 Known Limitations & Future Improvements

**We're transparent about where the Deflation Index is currently limited:**

### Current Scope Limitations

**Sectors Covered (v3.0.1)**:
- ✅ Computing, Communications, Energy, Transportation
- ❌ Healthcare, Education, Housing, Agriculture, Materials, Software-as-Service

**Coverage**: The current four sectors represent approximately 40% of measurable technological deflation, not 100%. We prioritize defensible measurement over comprehensive coverage.

**Expansion Timeline**: v4.0 (2027-2028) will add healthcare, education, and housing sectors with rebalanced weights.

### Methodological Choices

**Weighting System**:
- Current weights (29.41%, 23.53%, 29.41%, 17.65%) based on three factors: GDP contribution, enabling effect, and deflationary force
- Detailed weight justification and sensitivity analysis in docs/methodology/WEIGHT_JUSTIFICATION.md
- Alternative weighting schemes tested (equal-weight, GDP-weighted, expenditure-weighted)
- Results robust across methods (±15% variation)

**Index Construction**:
- Weighted averages used to capture sector contributions
- Alternative methods (arithmetic, expenditure-weighted) documented for comparison
- Cost-per-performance focus doesn't capture adoption friction or network effects

**Conservative Assumptions**:
- Where uncertainty exists, we choose more conservative estimates
- True technological deflation likely higher than measured
- The index understates the gap, not overstates it

### What We Don't Measure

**Out of Scope**:
- Free software/services (difficult to price)
- Quality-of-life improvements beyond performance metrics
- Network effects and adoption curves
- Regulatory and infrastructure friction
- Non-monetary benefits (convenience, accessibility)

**Why These Limitations**:
We prioritize verifiable, reproducible data over comprehensive coverage. Better to measure four sectors perfectly than twenty sectors poorly. Each limitation is an opportunity for future improvement.

### Data Frequency

**Current**:
- Annual major updates (new year's data incorporated Q1-Q2 of following year)
- Quarterly minor updates (corrections and refinements)
- 1-3 month lag from source publication

**Planned**:
- Monthly M2/CPI tracking (2027)
- Real-time dashboard (Phase 2)
- Automated data pipeline

## 📐 Methodology Summary

### The Master DI Formula

```
Master DI = (Computing × 0.2941) + (Communications × 0.2353) + (Energy × 0.2941) + (Transport × 0.1765)
```

**Weight Justification**:

These weights reflect relative economic importance across three dimensions:

1. **GDP Contribution**: Share of US GDP from these sectors
2. **Enabling Effect**: Degree to which other sectors depend on this technology
3. **Deflationary Force**: Magnitude of cost reduction in sector

**Sensitivity Analysis**:

We tested alternative weighting schemes:
- Equal weights (25% each): DI = -9.0% annual average
- GDP-weighted: DI = -8.5% annual average
- Expenditure-weighted: DI = -8.8% annual average
- Current method (multi-factor): DI = -9.21% annual average

**Result**: ±8% variation across methods. Core finding robust to weighting choice.

Full methodology documentation: [docs/methodology/](docs/methodology/)

### Calculation Process

1. **Measure cost-per-performance** for each component ($/GFLOPS, $/GB, $/kWh)
2. **Index to base year** (1990=100 for most components)
3. **Combine components within sectors** using weighted averages and sector-specific weights
4. **Calculate Master DI** from sector indices using formula above
5. **Compare to M2 and CPI** to reveal gaps

### The Gaps

**Deflation Gap (251pp cumulative, 8.4pp annual)**:
```
Deflation Gap = |Tech Deflation| + CPI Inflation
              = 96pp + 155pp = 251pp
```
Measures deflation that should have reached consumers but didn't.

**Abundance Gap (560pp cumulative, 12.1pp annual)**:
```
Abundance Gap = |Tech Deflation| + M2 Expansion - CPI Inflation
              = 96pp + 615pp - 155pp = 560pp
```
Measures total economic force captured rather than passed to consumers (includes monetary policy effects).

**Anyone can verify our work. That's the standard we hold ourselves to.**

### v3.0.1 Rebuild (December 2025)

This version represents a complete rebuild of the Master Deflation Index:
- All calculations now use formulas (previously hard-coded values)
- Weights referenced from single source for consistency
- 4-decimal precision (weights sum to exactly 1.0000)
- Fully reproducible and verifiable
- More accurate deflation measurements from source data

**Why numbers changed from v3.0**: Previous version used externally calculated values. v3.0.1 calculates directly from raw source data, revealing more accurate (and more dramatic) deflation rates.

## 🎯 Mission

**Built to measure the force of technological progress and track where the abundance goes.**

Technology is the primary driver of human prosperity. Understanding where those gains flow—to consumers, to capital holders, to asset prices, to complexity costs—is essential for economic policy and social equity.

The Deflation Index exists to provide objective, transparent, verifiable measurement of this phenomenon. Not as theory, but as data. Not as advocacy, but as economics. Not as accusation, but as measurement.
