## What is this?

The Deflation Index (DI) measures the force of technological progress by tracking exponential cost reductions in three fundamental sectors and comparing them against monetary expansion and official inflation metrics.

**Key Finding**: Technology created 6,337x value from 1990-2024. Inflation consumed ~99% of it. The gap is measurable, trackable, quantifiable.
