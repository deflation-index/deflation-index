The Deflation Index (DI) measures the force of technological progress by tracking exponential cost reductions across four fundamental sectors and comparing them against monetary expansion and official inflation metrics.

---

## 🔍 What is the DI?

The Deflation Index is a composite metric tracking technological deflation across four sectors:

- **Computing (25%)**: FLOPS/$, storage $/GB, memory $/GB RAM
- **Communications (20%)**: Data $/GB, voice $/minute, network $/Mbps
- **Energy (25%)**: Solar $/kWh LCOE, batteries $/kWh, LEDs $/lumen
- **Transportation (15%)**: EV batteries $/kWh, autonomous tech, vehicle efficiency
- **Future Technologies (15%)**: Reserved for emerging sectors (healthcare, education, etc.)

### The Central Question

Technology makes things cheaper. Money printing makes things expensive. What wins?

**The DI measures the gap between:**
- **What technology delivers**: -5.2% annual deflation (1990-2024)
- **What monetary policy creates**: +5.9% M2 expansion annually
- **What we experience**: +2.7% CPI inflation annually

**The 545 percentage point Abundance Gap** represents the greatest wealth transfer in modern history.

---

## 📊 Key Findings (1990-2024)

### Technology Delivered Massive Deflation

- **Master DI**: Fell from 100 (1990) to **15.68** (2024)
- **Total Deflation**: 84.3% over 35 years
- **Annual Average**: -5.2% deflation per year
- **Meaning**: What cost $100 in 1990 should cost **$16 today** (in real terms)

### But Money Supply Expanded Dramatically

- **M2 Growth**: +5.9% annually (average 1990-2024)
- **Cumulative**: +615% over 35 years (precise: 614.84%)
- **Multiplier**: 7.15x increase ($3.0T → $21.3T)
- **Peak Year**: 2020 with +24.6% (COVID-19 stimulus)

### While Consumer Prices Rose Modestly

- **CPI Inflation**: +2.7% annually (average 1990-2024)
- **Cumulative**: +155% over 35 years (precise: 154.65%)
- **Multiplier**: 2.55x increase
- **Pattern**: Stable except 2008 (financial crisis) and 2021-2022 (post-COVID)

### The Gaps: Where Did the Abundance Go?

We measure two related gaps that reveal the wealth transfer:

#### **The Abundance Gap: 545 Percentage Points** (Primary Metric)

**What it measures**: The total economic force that was captured rather than passed to consumers

**The Calculation**:
- Technology delivered: 84pp of price reductions
- M2 expanded: 615pp of inflationary pressure
- Combined force: 699pp of total economic pressure
- Consumer prices (CPI) rose: 155pp
- **Missing: 545pp captured elsewhere**

**Formula**: |Tech Deflation| + M2 Expansion - CPI Inflation = 84 + 615 - 155 = **545pp**

#### **The Deflation Gap: 239 Percentage Points** (Supporting Metric)

**What it measures**: Deflation that should have reached consumers but didn't

**The Calculation**:
- Technology delivered: 84pp of deflation
- Consumer prices rose: 155pp (opposite direction!)
- **Gap: 239pp** (84 + 155 = 239pp of "missing deflation")

**Annual**: 7.8pp per year (Tech -5.2% vs CPI +2.7% = 7.9pp difference)

**Formula**: |Tech Deflation| + CPI Inflation = **239pp**

---

### Where the 545pp Went

**Winners** (captured productivity gains):
1. **Corporate Profits**: Up 300%+ since 1990, concentrated in top 10%
2. **Asset Inflation**: Stocks +1,500%, housing +400% (not captured in CPI)
3. **Technology Platforms**: Network effects and monopoly pricing power
4. **Financial Engineering**: Buybacks, M&A, leverage amplifying returns
5. **International Arbitrage**: Manufacturing offshore, profits stay domestic

**Losers** (missed productivity gains):
1. **Bottom 50%**: Wage stagnation despite massive productivity increases
2. **Middle Class**: Housing/healthcare/education costs rising faster than wages
3. **Savers**: Real returns negative after inflation
4. **Fixed Income**: Purchasing power eroded
5. **Local Communities**: Hollowed out by offshoring

- **Storage**: 87.7% deflation ($0.114/GB → $0.014/GB, 2009-2024)
- **Memory**: 76.7% deflation ($15/GB → $3.50/GB, 2009-2024)
- **Average Deflation**: 35-40% annually

**Why It Matters**: Computing underpins every other sector. Cheaper computation enables AI, automation, and digital transformation.

### Communications Sector (20% weight)

**Components**:
- Data Transmission (70%): $/GB data transfer
- Voice (20%): $/minute telephone service
- Network Access (10%): $/Mbps bandwidth

**Coverage**: 1990-2024 (35 years)

**Key Results**:
- **Data Transmission**: 99.8% deflation (expensive dial-up → cheap 5G)
- **Voice**: 97.2% deflation (long-distance → unlimited VoIP)
- **Network Access**: 95% deflation ($/Mbps for broadband)
- **Average Deflation**: 30-35% annually

**Era Transitions**:
- 1990-1995: Pre-consumer internet (CompuServe/Prodigy era)
- 1995-2000: Dial-up internet ($20/month for 30 hours)
- 2000-2010: Broadband expansion (DSL vs Cable)
- 2010-2015: 4G/LTE, streaming begins
- 2015-2024: Unlimited plans, 5G, streaming dominance

**Sources**: Industry reports, BLS Telephone CPI, FCC data, historical pricing

### Energy Sector (25% weight)

**Components**:
- Solar PV (50%): $/kWh levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
- Battery Storage (40%): $/kWh storage capacity
- LED Lighting (10%): $/kilolumen efficacy

**Coverage**: 1990-2024 (35 years)

**Key Results**:
- **Solar**: 90% deflation since 2010 ($0.378/kWh → $0.043/kWh)

- **Average Deflation**: 12% (pre-2010), 27% (post-2010) - accelerating!

**Why Acceleration Post-2010?**:
- Learning curves (Wright's Law): Cost falls ~20% per production doubling
- Manufacturing scale-up: China dominates supply chain
- Technology maturity: Grid parity achieved
- Policy support: Climate targets drive deployment

**Sources**: IRENA, BloombergNEF, DOE Solid-State Lighting, FRED

**Why Start 2010?**: EVs not commercially viable before 2010. Tesla Roadster (2008) was first lithium-ion EV, but mass market began with Nissan Leaf (2010) and Tesla Model S (2012).

**Key Results**:
- **EV Batteries**: 88% deflation ($1,160/kWh → $139/kWh)

## 📈 The Deflation Gap Explained

### What Should Have Happened

If technology gains fully passed to consumers:
- **1990 baseline**: $100
- **2024 with 84% deflation**: $16
- **Your purchasing power**: 6.25x increase

### What Actually Happened  

With M2 growth but technology offsetting it:
- **1990 baseline**: $100  
- **2024 with 615% M2 growth**: $715 potential
- **Minus 84% tech deflation**: Should be $114 ($715 × 0.16)
- **Actual CPI**: $255 (155% increase)

### The Dual Gap Framework

**Deflation Gap (239pp)**:
- Tech should have reduced prices 84pp
- Prices rose 155pp instead
- Missing deflation: 239pp didn't reach consumers

**Abundance Gap (545pp)**:
- Tech deflation: 84pp down
- M2 expansion: 615pp up
- Net economic force: 699pp upward pressure
- CPI captured: 155pp
- Missing abundance: 545pp went elsewhere

### Who Captured the 545pp?

**Winners** (captured productivity gains):
- Top 1%: Asset values (stocks, real estate)
- Top 10%: Corporate profits, capital income
- Technology companies: Platform monopolies, network effects

**Losers** (missed productivity gains):
- Bottom 50%: Wage stagnation despite productivity
- Middle class: Housing/healthcare/education costs rising
- Savers: Real returns negative
